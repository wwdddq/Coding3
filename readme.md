# Reality and Virtual World
Real-Time Image Style Transfer
[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TrY03YGp5YR7jpOlBRLhhGvHfyEpgzaM)

## Introduction to the work
I hope that Reality and Virtual World will give the viewer a unique artistic experience and sensation. Through the rapid stylistic transfer of images in real time, the objective reality of photography is combined with the subjective expression of art, bringing a new sensory experience to the viewer. This technique blends elements of the real world with the artist's creativity, giving the photography a unique artistic and expressive quality.

The work uses a pre-trained [megenta model](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/tree/main/magenta/models/arbitrary_image_stylization) by rchen152 and the TensorFlow Hub library to transform the images captured by the camera into images with a specified style in real time. With this creation I have attempted to push the boundaries of traditional photography and painting and to tightly integrate the real world with artistic expression.
